# JOHN Mutua
I am a software engineering practitioner with a strong focus on **backend systems, DevOps, and structured system design**.  
My work emphasizes reliability, automation, and building systems that are production-oriented rather than experimental.

I am actively developing skills in **cloud infrastructure, CI/CD, agentic AI workflows, and scalable backend architectures**.

## Current Focus Areas
- Backend system design and API development
- DevOps fundamentals and cloud-native workflows
- Specification-driven development with AI agents
- Infrastructure monitoring and automation
- Security-aware application development
